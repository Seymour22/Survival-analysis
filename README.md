Here we first predict survival of controls and patients with LMCI or AD using the kaplan-meier estimate. We then investigate features that impact survival using the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model. Lastly, we investigate if groups of patients with AD have different survival trajectories.


[Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Computational-biology/blob/main/Survival%20analysis%20for%20brest%20cancer.ipynb) illustrates a survival analysis. Here we investigate if the survival of patients with breast cancer is associated with the detection of axillary nodes.


[Project3](https://github.com/Seymour22/Computational-biology/blob/main/Project%203:%20Preprocessing%20steps%20for%20GWAS%20using%20PLINK.ipynb) illustrates some of the preprocessing steps for a GWAS study.
