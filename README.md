[Project1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Computational-biology/blob/main/Project%201:%20Investigating%20the%20impact%20of%20brain%20atrophy%20on%20survival%20in%20Alzheimer's%20disease.ipynb) illustrates a survival analysis using the ADNI dataset. Here we investigate if atrophy in the hippocampus affects the survival of patients with LMCI and AD.


[Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Computational-biology/blob/main/Preprocessing%20steps%20for%20GWAS%20using%20PLINK.ipynb) illustrates some of the preprocessing steps for a GWAS study.


[Project3](https://github.com/Seymour22/Computational-biology/blob/main/Survival%20analysis%20for%20brest%20cancer.ipynb) illustrates a survival analysis. Here we investigate if the survival of patients with breast cancer is associated with the detection of axillary nodes.
